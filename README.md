##Sound changing space changing sound.##

Pusher/Puller is a architecturally-inspired physical device for pushing and pulling sound — an interactive architecture prototype. The device is meant to both stand on its own, reacting to what it hears, and provide control over the audio environment for the users.

By pushing and pulling the points along the shape’s exterior, users will be able to change the parameters of filters, delays, buffers, etc., allowing them to “play” the sounds around them as music.

I’ve long been interested in how the sound we hear is defined by the space we’re in — so I wanted to find a way to control the space myself, and therefore change where I hear.

The Pusher/Puller made its performance debut at Exit Art for the ITP NIME (New Interfaces for Musical Expression) Show in on December 13, 2007.
